# Java-MVC-Pong
This is my second year Assignment For a Pong game Application in JavaFX. The project requirement was to build a full game application in the MVC architecture. It was largely focused on good design and OOP practices for readability, maintainability, scalability, and abstraction for developers. For end users appearance, ease of navigation & functionality were the requirements.
